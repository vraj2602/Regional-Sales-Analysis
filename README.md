# 📊 USA Regional Sales Analysis: Strategic Revenue & Profitability Dashboard

A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore sales performance across the United States—focusing on regional growth, product profitability, channel efficiency, and customer segmentation.

## 📝 Short Description / Purpose
The **USA Regional Sales Analysis Dashboard** is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to provide Acme Co.’s leadership with actionable insights into their sales ecosystem. By analyzing historical order data from 2014 to 2018, this tool identifies high-performing geographic hubs, evaluates the health of various sales channels (In-Store, Online, Distributor, Wholesale), and monitors profit margins to drive data-backed expansion and pricing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The analysis and dashboard were built using the following tools and technologies:
* 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main platform for creating the 3-page interactive report and visual storytelling.
* 📂 **Power Query** – Facilitated the ETL process, joining multiple source files (Customers, Products, Regions) into a unified model.
* 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for advanced calculations like Year-over-Year growth, Profit Margin %, and Revenue KPIs.
* 🐍 **Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)** – Used for deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and correlation testing between price and profit.
* 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks** – Documented the end-to-end data cleaning and analysis workflow.

Provides a breakdown of sales by medium (In-Store, Online, etc.) and product. It identifies **Product 23 and 24** as top sellers and confirms that while sales volume varies, profit margins remain stable across the product catalog.

## 💡 Business Impact & Insights
* **Regional Strategy:** Identified that while California is the market leader, states like Illinois and Texas represent significant secondary growth hubs with high order density.
* **Seasonal Planning:** Detected a recurring volume uptick in May–June and a notable dip in early 2017, allowing management to better align inventory and marketing spend with seasonal cycles.
* **Pricing Optimization:** Python analysis confirmed no strong correlation between unit price and margin, suggesting a successful tiered pricing strategy that protects profitability across different price points.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Pinpointed the "AXW291" warehouse as a critical logistical hub, handling a disproportionate amount of volume.
